I'm Gemini in Firebase, and I can definitely help shed some light on this.\n\nWhen you're using the Firebase Admin SDK and encountering a '5 NOT_FOUND' error, even after enabling the Cloud Firestore API and creating your database, it usually points to an issue with how your application is identifying or accessing that specific Firestore instance.\n\nHere are the most common culprits:\n\n1.  **Project ID Mismatch:** The Admin SDK needs to know *which* Firebase project it's supposed to be interacting with. While you've created the database in 'studio-6801224319-7a315', your Node.js script might not be correctly initialized with this exact project ID. This is a very common oversight.\n\n2.  **Service Account Key Configuration:** Even with `gcloud auth application-default login`, the Admin SDK often benefits from explicit initialization with a service account key file, especially in server environments. If the key file isn't correctly generated, stored, or referenced in your code, the SDK might not be able to authenticate properly to *your specific project*.\n\n3.  **Database Instance Name (Less Common for Default Firestore):** While Firestore typically has a single default database per project, if you've done something unusual or are in an environment where multiple database instances are possible, ensuring you're targeting the correct instance (which is usually `(default)`) is important. For 99% of users, this isn't the issue, but it's worth a quick mental check.\n\nIn essence, the 'NOT_FOUND' error in this context often means \"I can't find *that specific database instance within the project I think I'm connected to*.\"\n\nTo explore this further, you might want to ask:\n*   How do I correctly initialize the Firebase Admin SDK in my Node.js script with my project ID?\n*   What's the recommended way to set up service account authentication for the Firebase Admin SDK in a Node.js environment?\n*   Can you show me an example of a simple Node.js script that successfully connects to Firestore using the Admin SDK?","author":"model"}]},"outputDataContext":{"additionalContext":{"@type":"type.googleapis.com/google.cloud.cloudaicompanion.v1main.ChatOutputDataContext","relatedContent":{}}},"attributionContext":{"citationMetadata":{}}}
